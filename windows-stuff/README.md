# IMPORTANT NOTE

The windows disk partitioning shit only allows incrememntal IDs for the sake of identifying.
What an atrocious mess compared to NixOS.

Anyway, unplug your data disks or disable them in the BIOS or something, to ensure windows doesn't stomp all
over them.

IDK what happens if it dares put your install media ahead of the disk, lol, good luck?
